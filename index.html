<h1>Project Proposal: Estimating Erosion Rates of the Hawaiian Islands</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<br/>
  <p>Erosion rates on the Hawaiian Islands are often studied and part of that process is estimating the mass flux of an island or part of an island. This can be done by estimating the amount of material that has left the system. The app would let the researcher do this quickly and efficiently.</p>
<h2>Project Questions</h2>
<h3>What kind of vector and raster data analysis will be required?</h3>
<p>The app would require several different vector and raster data analyses. The tools that would be needed are:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Clip</li>                 <li>Interpolation</li>
      <li>Zonal Statistics</li>     <li>Extract Data by Point</li>
      <li>Raster Calculator</li>    <li>Flow Accumulation</li>
  </ul>
